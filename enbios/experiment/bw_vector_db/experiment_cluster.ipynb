    "Traditional hierarchical clustering, as implemented in methods such as scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage, always merges exactly two clusters at a time. This is inherent to the way this type of clustering is defined.\n",

    "However, there are alternatives that might suit your needs better:\n",
    "\n",
    "    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This is a density-based clustering algorithm, where a cluster is a dense pack of points. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can discover clusters of arbitrary shape. It works based on two parameters: eps (the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other) and min_samples (the number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point).\n",
    "\n",
    "    HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This is an extension of DBSCAN that converts the eps parameter into a range, allowing it to discover clusters of varying densities. It creates a hierarchy of clusters at different scales and stably extracts a flat clustering based on stability over scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "    OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure): It's an algorithm for finding density-based clusters in spatial data. It's similar to DBSCAN, but can find clusters of various densities unlike DBSCAN. It doesn't require a prior knowledge of the number of clusters, but needs two other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms can group together more than two points at a time based on their spatial/density properties. You can find all of them in the sklearn.cluster module of scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these are fundamentally different approaches to clustering compared to traditional hierarchical clustering. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on your specific use case and the nature of your data."
